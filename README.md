TODO
----

- better support for contexts, more than just gitconf
- make makefile smarter?
- make fish prompt better
- right now relying on installed binaries, should I source control:
  - eslint_d, prettier, etc?

core technologies
--------------------------
  nvim
  tmux
  git
  lsc

things to improve:
  plugin usage
  snippets
  omnicomplete
  linting / prettier / zig fmt, etc

boot up expectation checking of installed binaries
  js:
    prettier
    eslint_d
  zig:
    zig
